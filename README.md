# Introduction

These matherials relate to my Master Thesis [**"Design of cooperative communication system based on CubeSat satellites"**](https://books.google.ru/books/about/Design_of_Cooperative_Communication_Syst.html?id=bPIWtAEACAAJ&redir_esc=y) that were completed in August 2017 and developed more deeply during 2017-2018 (as a hobby).

So, I guess it's also necessary to say couple of words about research object - CubeSat satellites. Briefly, it is the type of miniaturized satellites that used primiraly for education and science in the begining of their history \(the standard was developed in 1999\). Nowadays, CubeSats are used in navigation and other commercial applications more and more. We believe, that communication is also branch for CubeSats and therefore we've tried to increase their radiolink capacity during our research. In short, we can mention that theoretically it is possible and prospective.

Table 1.1 CubeSat's basic configurations 

| CubeSat format | Dimensions, cm | Mass, kg |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1U | 10x10x10 | 1.33 |
| 1.5U | 15x10x10 | 2 |
| 2U | 20x10x10 | 2.66 |
| 3U | 30x10x10 | 4 |
| 6U | 30x20x10 | 12 |

Actually, CubeSats are very interesting topic and if you want to learn more you can visit the official site of [The AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/) .

Thank you for your attention and you are welcome!
